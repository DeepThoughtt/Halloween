# Halloween
Personal dark theme for Notepad++

I tried to find a set of colours that didn't hurt the eyes in a long coding session and were pleasant to code with.
Feedback and constructive criticism is well accepted.

To install this theme, drag and drop the XML file in the `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\themes` folder. If you
also want to have .md support you have to put the `userDefinedLang-markdown.default.modern.xml` file in the `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs` directory.
I suggest you copy the file already in the folder somewhere else before replacing it, so you can put it back if you don't want to use the Halloween
theme anymore.<br/>
To select this theme,  go in the `Settings -> Style Configuration` menu in Notepad++ and select the *"Halloween"* theme.
